# Web Flask - AirBnB Clone

This directory contains the Flask application for the AirBnB clone project. It's designed to introduce the foundational concepts of building a web application with the Flask framework.

## Structure

The `web_flask` directory includes Python scripts that define various routes and view functions to serve HTTP responses for the AirBnB clone.

### Files and Directories

- `__init__.py`: Initializes the Python package and may include application configuration settings.
- `0-hello_route.py`: A simple Flask application that starts a web server and displays "Hello HBNB!" at the root URL.
- Other scripts (e.g., `1-hbnb_route.py`, `2-c_route.py`): Each subsequent script introduces more complex Flask functionalities like dynamic URLs.
- `templates/`: This directory (if present) will contain HTML files for rendering responses.
- `static/`: This directory (if present) will store static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

## Installation and Setup

To run any of the Flask applications in this directory, ensure you have Flask installed. If Flask is not installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask
